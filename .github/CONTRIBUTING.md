## Translations

[Internationalization](https://github.com/Soundux/Soundux/issues/52) is not yet implemented. When we have a way to do this, we add the instructions here.

## Code

1. [Fork](https://github.com/Soundux/Soundux/fork) the repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork.
2. Start coding!
    - Implement your feature.
    - Check your code works as expected.
    - Run the code formatter: `clang-format -i $(git ls-files "*.cpp" "*.hpp")`

3. Commit your changes to a new branch (not `master`, one change per branch) and push it:
    - Use [Semantic Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)

4. Once you are happy with your changes, submit a pull request.
     - Open the pull-request.
     - Add a short description explaining briefly what you've done (or if it's a work-in-progress - what you need to do)

## Issues

1. Do a quick search in the [existing issues](https://github.com/Soundux/Soundux/issues) to check if the issue has already been reported.
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/Soundux/Soundux/issues/new/choose) and fill in the template

After reporting you should try to answer any questions or clarifications, as this will help determine the cause of the issue.
