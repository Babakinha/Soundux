/*

    Use the current way of playing audio here.
    See: soundplayback.cpp@master

    Would be nice to change that though, the problem is that miniaudio can't create sinks (as far as I know)
    However we can use miniaudio to play the audio on that sink - this would remove the depenency on mpg123 (?)
